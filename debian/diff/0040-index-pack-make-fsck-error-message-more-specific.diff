Subject: index-pack: make fsck error message more specific

commit db5a58c1bda5b20169b9958af1e8b05ddd178b01 upstream.

If fsck reports an error, we say only "Error in object".
This isn't quite as bad as it might seem, since the fsck
code would have dumped some errors to stderr already. But it
might help to give a little more context. The earlier output
would not have even mentioned "fsck", and that may be a clue
that the "fsck.*" or "*.fsckObjects" config may be relevant.
